            <h3>Directory Structure</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Create a directory in your User Data to hold your sounds</li>

            <ul><li>For example, 'Battle Sounds', 'Animals' etc.</li></ul>
            <li>Inside each of these category directories, place your audio files</li>
            <ul><li>You can place another directory inside the category directories in order to create a Wildcard Sound. To do this, create a directory with the sound name you wish to use, then fill that directory with all of the possible wildcard audio files.</li></ul>
            </ol>
            <h3>Module Settings</h3>
            <p>Once you have set up your directory structure, go to the modules settings and change them to reference your new directory.</p>
            <p>Be sure to check the Source Type if you are hosting via an S3 bucket or The Forge.</p>
            <p>When you save your settings, Foundry should refresh. You should now see your custom audio inside the SoundBoard.</p>`},

            <li>Generate a macro if it doesn't exist</li>

            <p>Activating a macro, either directly or through a journal, will broadcast the sound through SoundBoard</p>
            <p>Holding Shift while activating the macro, either directly or through a journal, will force your players to load and cache the sound instead of playing it.</p>
            <p>This works in the same way as Caching Mode, allowing the GM to preload sounds so all of their players will hear them at the same time when they are played.</p>

            <p>This should point to a directory containing your SoundBoard audio setup. See 'Setting Up Custom Audio' for more information</p>
            <h3>Source Type</h3>
            <p>Tells the Foundry Filepicker where your custom audio is.</p>
            <p>'Forge' should be selected if your server is Forge hosted, and your sounds are in your Forge Assets.</p>
            <p>'S3' should be selected if your audio is hosted in an AWS S3 bucket.</p>
            <p>For anything else, 'Data' should work.</p>
            <h3>Defocus Opacity</h3>
            <p>This controls the opacity of the SoundBoard when you don't have your mouse hovered over it. Useful if you'd like to see your scene underneat SoundBoard.</p>
            <h3>Random Detune Amount</h3>
            <p>Increase this value to randomly alter the pitch of sounds each time they are played.</p>

        <h3>Bundled Sounds</h3>
        <p>As of 1.4.0, SoundBoard's old Bundled Sounds have been moved into the <a href="https://github.com/BlitzKraig/fvtt-SoundBoard-BlitzFreePack">Blitz Free Pack</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/BlitzKraig/fvtt-SoundBoard-BlitzCommunityPack">Community Pack</a></p>
        <h3>Sound Packs</h3>
        <p>Sound Packs are small modules containing a collection of SoundBoard sounds. They can be installed and activated, and should instantly appear in your Bundled Sounds soundboard.</p>
        <p>You can enable and disable individual packs using the Package Manager, which can be accessed via the button at the top right of the SoundBoard</p>
        <p><button style="width: 40px;
            height: 26px;

            <i class="fas fa-tasks"></i>
          </button></p>
        <p>Any module can provide sounds for SoundBoard to use as a Sound Pack. The sounds should be placed in the same directory structure as Custom Sounds, and some code should be called:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Listen for the <code>SBPackageManagerReady</code> Hook</li>
        <li>Call <code>SoundBoard.packageManager.addSoundPack(packName, packDir, moduleName, {licenses, description, link, author});</code></li>
        <ul><li>The final object is optional, but recommended.</li>
        <li><code>licenses</code> should be an array of license objects, containing <code>licenseUrl, licenseType</code> and <code>licenseDescription</code>. See one of the sound packs linked above for an example.</li>
        </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>This approach allows users to create dedicated Sound Packs, or ship SoundBoard sounds with their existing modules, worlds and systems.</p>
